# Dog vs Cat Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Introduction
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and it leverages the OpenCV (cv2) library for image preprocessing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset consisting of labeled images of dogs and cats. The dataset was preprocessed using OpenCV to resize images to a uniform size (256x256 pixels) and normalize pixel values.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used for this classification task is as follows:

1. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - 3 convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128) and ReLU activation.
   - Each convolutional layer is followed by Batch Normalization and Max Pooling to extract features and reduce spatial dimensions.

2. **Flatten Layer**:
   - Flattens the 3D output from the convolutional layers into a 1D vector to be fed into the dense layers.

3. **Dense Layers**:
   - 2 fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation (128 units, 64 units) and dropout regularization (0.1).
   - Final output layer with 1 unit and sigmoid activation function for binary classification (dog or cat).

4. **Model Compilation**:
   - Loss function: Binary Crossentropy
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Metrics: Accuracy

## Training
The model is trained on a GPU-enabled environment to expedite training due to the complexity of convolutional operations and the size of the dataset.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure your images are organized into 'dog' and 'cat' folders or labeled accordingly.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Use the provided script or Jupyter Notebook to train the model on your dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its performance metrics.

4. **Inference**:
   - Use the trained model to classify new images of dogs and cats.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) for better performance.
- Experimenting with different CNN architectures (e.g., VGG, ResNet) for improved accuracy.
- Data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
